# Chinese-Remainder-Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem gives a unique solution to a set of linear congruences if their moduli are coprime.

This means, that given a set of arbitrary integers ai, and pairwise coprime integers ni, such that the following linear congruences hold:

Note "pairwise coprime integers" means that if we have a set of integers {n1, n2, ..., ni}, all pairs of integers selected from the set are coprime: gcd(ni, nj) = 1.


x ≡ a1 mod n1
x ≡ a2 mod n2
...
x ≡ an mod nn


There is a unique solution x ≡ a mod N where N = n1 * n2 * ... * nn.

In cryptography, we commonly use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to help us reduce a problem of very large integers into a set of several, easier problems.

Given the following set of linear congruences:

x ≡ 2 mod 5
x ≡ 3 mod 11
x ≡ 5 mod 17


Find the integer a such that x ≡ a mod 935

Starting with the congruence with the largest modulus, use that for x ≡ a mod p we can write x = a + k*p for arbitrary integer k.
